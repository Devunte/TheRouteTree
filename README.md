# TheRouteTree


## Description

This is a e-commerce database full of different products and other items. I created this database in order to store items such as T-shirts, sneakers, baseball hats, and other clothing items. While creating this database, I created different routes that were labeled by categories products, and tags the same routes were used as models and also seated with the same name.
